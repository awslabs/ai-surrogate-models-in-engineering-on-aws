# AI Surrogate Models in Engineering on AWS (MLSimKit)

AI Surrogate Models in Engineering on AWS (project name: ML for Simulation Toolkit or MLSimKit) is a Python library that enables engineers to use machine learning models for near real-time predictions of physics-based simulations. By training models on existing simulation data, MLSimKit allows for rapid design iterations without the computational expense of traditional simulations.

## Key Features

- **KPI Prediction**: Predict key performance indicators (e.g., drag coefficient, lift coefficient) directly from geometries
- **Slice Prediction**: Generate 2D cross-sectional slices of flow fields from 3D geometries
- **Surface Variable Prediction**: Predict surface properties (e.g., pressure, wall shear stress) on 3D geometries
